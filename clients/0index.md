In addition to server applications, Ktor supports asynchronous clients
connecting to other services. You can create client-only applications with it,
or create mixed complex applications, that not only serve resources, but also communicate
with external services.

Ktor directly supports [Raw Sockets](/clients/raw-sockets.html), [HTTP Clients](/clients/http-client.html) and [WebSockets](/clients/websockets.html).
Using Raw Sockets, it is possible to implement clients with higher level protocols.
